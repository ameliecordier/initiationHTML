Step 1 - Two sides of an HTML page: code and display
====================================================

- Open ``page0.html`` in a web browser. Don't close it. 
- Open ``page0.html`` in a text editor and observe the code. Don't close this file neither.
- Learn to switch between the text editor and the browser, for example, by using ``Alt+Tab`` on the keyboard.


Step 2 - Your first edit
========================

- Edit the code of the webpage in the text editor. For example, add your name where it should be. 
- Save your changes in the text editor.
- Reload the page in the browser and make sure your changes are visible.


Remember...
===========

- Do not forget to save your edits in the text editor before refreshing a page.
- You do not need to close the editor nor the web browser.
- The "Alt+Tab" shortcut is convenient to switch between the two applications.


Step 3 - HTML tags
==================

HTML is based on tags. A tag is a way to indicate that a part of the document as a specific role.

For example, if you want to stress your name in the sentence, you can use the :html:`<em>` tag.

Here is an example. Try it!

.. html-raw::

   My name is <em>Amélie</em>


Understanding HTML tags
=======================

Most of the time, HTML elements have a *start tag* and a *end tag*.

Tags names are written inside angle brackets the greater than & less than symbols “<” & “>”)

In the end tag, the tag name is preceded with a forward slash (/) sign.

Step 4 - Let's try another tag
==============================

This is your **first** web page, it is very important. Try to use the :html:`<strong>` tag around the word *first* in the web page.
