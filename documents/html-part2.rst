==================================
HTML - Part 2 - More HTML elements
==================================


Nested elements
===============

HTML elements can be nested (elements can contain other elements).

Example:
<p> This is a <strong>very important</strong> paragraph.</p>

However, be careful when you include an element in another.

For example, this is not correct : 
<p> This is a <strong>very important paragraph.</p></strong>

Weird behavior and unexpected errors.


Headings
========

We have already seen the :hmtl:`h1` element to define a title (heading).

You can have several levels of headings in your document: use h2 for second level, h3 for third level and so on.

Open page3.html and edit the document to include headings.

"What will I learn today?" should be a level 1 headings
"About the web", "About HTML", and "About CSS" should be level 2 headings.

The result should look like this.




Lists 
=====

HTML defines two types of lists: ordered lists, and unordered lists.

In both, a list item is identified by the li element.

See the examples bellow.

.. TODO : faire l'exemple. 


Make your own lists
===================

Open page3.html and use the elements you've just discovered to add lists.
The text is already written for you.
The result should look like this:
.. TODO faire un screenshoot du résultat. 

If you have time, add a link from this page to page2, and from page2 to this page. 


.. TODO : remettre dans le cours 1 qu'ils doivent apprendre à repérer les touches sur le clavier 



Summary
=======

Alway close tags (except in some very rare cases such as img)
